\code{read_ktdb_file} reads old-age mortality data from a file downloaded from
K-T database (\url{https://www.demogr.mpg.de/cgi-bin/databases/ktdb/datamap.plx})
and constructs a \code{vital} object suitable for use in other functions.
If two files are provided, the function will treat them as data for each gender,
returning a combined dataset. If only one file is provided, the function will
assume that it represents data for a single gender.
