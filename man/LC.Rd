\title{Lee-Carter model}
\usage{
LC(
  formula,
  adjust = c("dt", "dxt", "e0", "none"),
  jump_choice = c("fit", "actual"),
  scale = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model specification. It should include the log of the variable to be modelled.
See the examples.}

\item{adjust}{method to use for adjustment of coefficients \eqn{k_t}.
Possibilities are
\code{"dt"} (Lee-Carter method, the default),
\code{"dxt"} (BMS method),
\code{"e0"} (Lee-Miller method based on life expectancy) and
\code{"none"}.}

\item{jump_choice}{Method used for computation of jump-off point for forecasts.
Possibilities: \code{"actual"} (use actual rates from final year) and
\code{"fit"} (use fitted rates).
The original Lee-Carter method used \code{"fit"} (the default), but Lee and Miller (2001)
and most other authors prefer \code{"actual"}.}

\item{scale}{If TRUE, \code{bx} and \code{kt} are rescaled so that \code{kt} has drift parameter = 1.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A model specification.
}
\description{
Lee-Carter model of mortality or fertility rates.
\code{LC()} returns a Lee-Carter model applied to the formula's response
variable as a function of age. This produces a standard Lee-Carter model by
default, although many other options are available. Missing rates are set to
the geometric mean rate for the relevant age.

lc <- aus_mortality |>
  dplyr::filter(State == "Victoria", Sex == "female") |>
  model(lee_carter = LC(log(Mortality)))
